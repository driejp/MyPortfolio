# Welcome to My Data Analytics Portfolio
Hello! I’m a passionate data analyst with hands-on experience in SQL, predictive analytics, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP). My work focuses on using data-driven insights to address complex health and clinical challenges. Here’s a brief overview of my experience and the projects I’ve worked on during my time at Morehouse School of Medicine.

# About Me
I hold a background in data analytics and have developed skills in transforming raw data into meaningful insights that drive impactful decisions. At Morehouse, I had the opportunity to work with healthcare datasets, leveraging advanced analytical techniques to address health-related issues and optimize patient outcomes.

# Skills & Tools
- Programming Languages: Python, SQL
- Data Analysis: Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization
- Machine Learning: Supervised learning, predictive modeling
- NLP (Natural Language Processing): Clinical text processing for healthcare insights
- Tools & Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, SQL databases

# Featured Projects
1. Prediction of Coronary Heart Disease Using Supervised Machine Learning
   - Description: Developed a machine learning model to predict the risk of coronary heart disease using patient data and clinical indicators.
   - Techniques Used: Supervised learning algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest), feature selection, and model evaluation.
   - Outcome: Achieved an accurate predictive model that supports early intervention and risk assessment, demonstrating the power of data in improving patient outcomes.

2. Clinical Text Processing with NLP
   - Description: Applied NLP techniques to process and analyze clinical notes and text data, aiming to extract meaningful insights from unstructured clinical data.
   - Techniques Used: Tokenization, named entity recognition, and topic modeling.
   - Outcome: Successfully converted raw clinical text into structured insights, which could help improve clinical decision-making and patient record management.
